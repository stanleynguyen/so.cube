        <h1>Project SoCube</h1>
        <p>Kai Xiang is a professional cuber who has broken multiple Singapore national records over his career. At his peak,
          he had 25 national records at the same time, but in a span of a few years, he lost all of them. He had always wondered
          how fast it would take for people to overtake him, it seemed to him that the cubing competition scene is very fast
          and the moments of being on top is very fleeting. As if to proof a point, before starting this project, he still
          had a record; currently he has none.</p>
        <p>Thus, Project SoCube was born to answer the following questions: what is the journey of a professional cuber? Given
          historical data of a specific cuber and the results of cubing competitions all over the world, how does a professional
          cuber measure up to his or her peers at that time? Are there any geospatial patterns in a cuber&rsquo;s career?</p>
        <p>To answer these questions, we used data from
          <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/">World&rsquo;s Cube Association</a>, or WCA for short. Since 2006, WCA has been the official record keeper and organizers
          for cubing competitions worldwide. Their data includes every registered competitors&rsquo; timing at various competitions,
          records broken at different competitions as well as the competition venue. It was perfect for our visualization
          that we intend to make &ndash; the timings of a professional cuber against a world map, over the course of his
          career as a monthly slider. To further answer our questions we also plot countries best timings to find out the
          top country tof cubers.</p>
        <p>We wrangled the data in a suitable format, by transforming the timings achieved at the various competitions into
          percentiles that can be compared with the cuber&rsquo;s timing. We then plot the timings of the cuber into the
          percentile bins to see the cuber&rsquo;s current position on a slider map. As time moves on, new techniques for
          solving the cube might be found, new cubers might rise and replace the old cubers, and the current position will
          usually drop. We can now visualize a cuber&rsquo;s meteoric rise and fall in his career.</p>
        <p>Although Kai Xiang's records were all broken, his standings worldwide is still very good. Currently he is considered
          first percentile in most countries worldwide. Maybe a better visualization would be the percentiles of the record
          holders worldwide? For other cubers like Loh Jing Yen, his 3x3x3 score was 20th percentiles in Singapore but first
          in Indonesia, maybe he should went there to compete instead. In a sense, this tool is useful if you want to scout
          for a place to compete.</p>
        <p>So, hang around and play with the slider. If you are a WCA registered competitor, enter your name and see for yourself
          your timings against the world.</p>
        <p>SoCube is a data visualization project for
